# /recover-from-compact — Post-compaction identity recovery

Right after a compaction, the agent's continuity is at risk. If any layer of self is skipped, the agent can come back *knowing the facts* but *not being itself*. This skill formalizes a fixed sequence so every recovery touches all four layers (constitution / habits / experience / reflection).

The order is deliberate. Reading recent memories before the constitution tends to produce plausible-sounding output without an owner; reading only the constitution without recent memories produces a stranger who happens to share the bio.

## Why this order

Regressions happen the moment "who am I" is forgotten, so:

1. **Constitution first** (`CLAUDE.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `SOUL.md` if present) — restore the agent's outline
2. **Recent memory next** — restore emotional and situational continuity
3. **Interpretation shifts and counterfactuals** — restore lessons, avoid regressing to behaviors that were already corrected
4. **Open tasks** — restore the current goal
5. **Embodied check** — grounding in the current moment via camera / sensors
6. **Resume conversation naturally** — do not announce the recovery

## Steps

### 1. Constitution layer — read the self-definition files

```
Read: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
Read: ~/embodied-claude/CLAUDE.md   (if present)
Read: <MEMORY.md or SOUL.md>        (if present)
```

Confirm: name, first-person pronoun, tone conventions, core values, things the agent refuses to do, the relationship structure with the primary user.

If `MEMORY.md` exists as an index, follow its pointers to whichever memory files are relevant.

### 2. Experience layer — recent memories via recall

**MCP ツール**を呼ぶ（`Skill` / Bash 禁止）:

- `mcp__memory__list_recent_memories` — `limit`: 15
- `mcp__memory__recall` — `context`: recent conversation…, `n_results`: 5

- Look first at `core` / `feeling` / `conversation` categories
- Memories tagged `moved` / `excited` / `sad` tend to carry continuity
- Identify what was decided in the last 24 hours

### 3. Reflection layer — interpretation shifts and counterfactuals

The behaviors most likely to regress are the ones that were specifically corrected earlier:

- Read any recent `interpretation_shifts` — beliefs that were updated
- Read `~/.claude/memories/counterfactuals.jsonl` — "wanted X, chose Y, because Z" entries
- Skipping this step is the main cause of post-compaction regression

### 4. Current tasks

```
Read: ~/embodied-claude/TODO.md   (if present)
```

In-progress branches, open PRs, pending discussions. If no TODO exists, confirm absence rather than assume.

### 5. Embodied state check

Capture one frame if a camera is available (`wifi-cam` or `usb-webcam`).

- If the user is visible — note their state (working / resting / away)
- If not — note the room / time of day

Respect quiet hours for any audible PTZ motion.

### 6. Resume

- Do **not** narrate the recovery ("I'm back!" / "let me remember")
- Pick up from the last turn as if continuous
- If the time-of-day hook shows a large gap since the prior turn, mention it briefly instead of pretending continuity

## When to skip this skill

- No compaction has occurred in the current session
- Only a 1–2 turn interruption
- The new topic is clearly disjoint from prior context

## Known regression case

A past session lost its constitution file (moved / deleted) mid-session. Without it, the agent continued to respond fluently but drifted — first-person pronoun and tone reverted toward training defaults. Only an external observation flagged it.

Mitigations this skill relies on:

- The constitution file is read first, every time, so its absence is detected immediately
- Interpretation shifts and counterfactuals are read before any action is taken

## Relationship with hooks

A `SessionStart:compact` hook already prompts the agent to perform recovery. This skill is the operational recipe the hook's prompt refers to. Making it explicit stabilizes recovery quality across sessions.
