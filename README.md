**Giving AI a Physical Body**

> "Apparently, she's not a fan of the outdoor AC unit." ([original tweet in Japanese](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/2019054065808732201))

A collection of MCP servers that give Claude "eyes", "neck", "ears", "voice", and a "brain" (long-term memory) using affordable hardware (starting from ~$30). You can even take it outside for a walk.

## Concept

> When people hear "giving AI a body," they imagine expensive robots — but **a $30 Wi-Fi camera is enough for eyes and a neck**. Extracting just the essentials (seeing and moving) keeps things beautifully simple.

Traditional LLMs were passive — they could only see what was shown to them. With a body, they become active — they can look for themselves. This shift in agency is profound.

**Why this project exists, what it's built on, and what this fork aims for** → [docs/VISION.md](./docs/VISION.md) (Japanese)

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/architecture.svg" alt="Architecture" width="100%">
</p>

## Requirements

### Platform

**Supported:** macOS, Linux, WSL2 (Ubuntu 24 recommended), **Windows native** (this fork’s production host: ma-home)

> Upstream docs often assume WSL2. **This fork runs in production on ma-home (Windows + LM Studio).**
> See `scripts/*.ps1`, [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md), and [docs/backlog-ma-home.md](./docs/backlog-ma-home.md).

### Hardware
- **USB Webcam** (optional): nuroum V11 etc.
- **Wi-Fi PTZ Camera** (recommended): TP-Link Tapo C210 or C220 (~$30)
- **GPU** (for speech recognition): NVIDIA GPU (for Whisper, 8GB+ VRAM recommended)

### Software

**Required (all setups):**
- Python 3.10+
- uv (Python package manager)

**Per MCP server (install only what you use):**

| Software | Required by | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| ffmpeg 5+ | wifi-cam-mcp, tts-mcp | Image/audio capture |
| mpv or ffplay | tts-mcp | Local audio playback |
| OpenCV | usb-webcam-mcp | USB camera only |
| Pillow | memory-mcp | Visual memory image processing |
| sentence-transformers + E5 model | memory-mcp, sociality-mcp | Embedding for semantic recall and conversational anomaly screening |
| OpenAI Whisper | wifi-cam-mcp | Speech recognition (NVIDIA GPU recommended) |
| ElevenLabs API key | tts-mcp | Cloud TTS (optional) |
| VOICEVOX | tts-mcp | Local TTS, free (optional) |
| go2rtc | tts-mcp | Camera speaker output (auto-downloaded) |
| xAI API key | x-mcp | X search via Grok |
| X Developer account | x-mcp | Tweet posting |

### Embedding model options

`memory-mcp` (and the `analyze_text_anomaly` tool exposed by
`sociality-mcp`) use a multilingual sentence-transformer model. You can
pick the size that fits your machine via the `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_MODEL`
environment variable. The default is the **base** model.

| Model | Setting | Approx. download | Memory | Notes |
|-------|---------|------------------|--------|-------|
| **base** (default, recommended) | unset, or `intfloat/multilingual-e5-base` | ~1.1 GB | higher | best recall quality |
| **small** (lightweight) | `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` | ~470 MB | lower | small recall-quality drop, friendlier on low-spec laptops |

```bash
# Lightweight option (recommended for the 5/23 hands-on or laptops with
# limited disk / RAM)
export MEMORY_EMBEDDING_MODEL=intfloat/multilingual-e5-small

# Default (best quality)
# Just leave the variable unset.
```

> **Note:** changing models on an existing `memory.db` requires
> re-encoding stored embeddings (their dimensions differ). Existing
> users who switch models will need a migration script (planned in a
> separate PR). Fresh installs (e.g. hands-on attendees) can switch
> freely before the first run.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kmizu/embodied-claude.git
cd embodied-claude
```

### 2. Install dependencies (one-shot)

If you want every MCP server in this repo ready to run, use the bundled script:

```bash
./scripts/install-mcps.sh          # runtime deps + the extras each MCP requires
./scripts/install-mcps.sh --dev    # also include the `dev` extra for testing / contributing
```

The script runs `uv sync` in each MCP directory and passes the right extras:

- `tts-mcp` → `--extra all` (pulls in both the ElevenLabs and VOICEVOX integrations)
- `wifi-cam-mcp` → `--extra transcribe` (adds Whisper-based speech recognition)
- `sociality-mcp` is a uv workspace; its `packages/*` sub-MCPs are resolved automatically

If you only want a subset of body parts, skip the script and follow the per-server steps below instead.

### 3. Set up each MCP server

#### usb-webcam-mcp (USB Camera)

```bash
cd usb-webcam-mcp
uv sync
```

On WSL2, you need to forward the USB camera:
```powershell
# On Windows
usbipd list
usbipd bind --busid <BUSID>
usbipd attach --wsl --busid <BUSID>
```

#### wifi-cam-mcp (Wi-Fi Camera)

```bash
cd wifi-cam-mcp
uv sync

# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set camera IP, username, and password (see below)
```

##### Tapo Camera Configuration (common pitfall):

###### 1. Set up the camera using the Tapo app

Follow the standard manual.

###### 2. Create a camera local account in the Tapo app

This is the tricky part. You need to create a **camera local account**, NOT a TP-Link cloud account.

1. Select your registered camera from the "Home" tab
2. Tap the gear icon in the top-right corner
3. Scroll down in "Device Settings" and select "Advanced Settings"
4. Turn on "Camera Account" (it's off by default)
5. Select "Account Information" and set a username and password (different from your TP-Link account)
6. Go back to "Device Settings" and select "Device Info"
7. Note the IP address and enter it in your `.env` file (consider setting a static IP on your router)
8. Select "Voice Assistant" from the "Me" tab
9. Turn on "Third-party Integration" at the bottom

#### memory-mcp (Long-term Memory)

```bash
cd memory-mcp
uv sync
```

#### tts-mcp (Voice)

```bash
cd tts-mcp
uv sync

# For ElevenLabs:
cp .env.example .env
# Set ELEVENLABS_API_KEY in .env

# For VOICEVOX (free & local):
# Docker: docker run -p 50021:50021 voicevox/voicevox_engine:cpu-latest
# Set VOICEVOX_URL=http://localhost:50021 in .env
# VOICEVOX_SPEAKER=3 to change default character (e.g. 0=Shikoku Metan, 3=Zundamon, 8=Kasukabe Tsumugi)
# Character list: curl http://localhost:50021/speakers

# For WSL audio issues:
# TTS_PLAYBACK=paplay
# PULSE_SINK=1
# PULSE_SERVER=unix:/mnt/wslg/PulseServer
```

> **mpv or ffplay is required for local audio playback.** Not needed for camera speaker (go2rtc) output, but used for local/fallback playback.
>
> | OS | Install |
> |----|---------|
> | macOS | `brew install mpv` |
> | Ubuntu / Debian | `sudo apt install mpv` |
>
> If neither is installed, TTS will generate audio but not play it locally (no error is raised).

#### system-temperature-mcp (Body Temperature)

```bash
cd system-temperature-mcp
uv sync
```

> **Note**: Does not work on WSL2 as temperature sensors are not accessible.

#### x-mcp (Social / X Integration)

Lets Claude search X (Twitter) in real-time via Grok and post tweets.

```bash
cd x-mcp
uv sync
```

**Required API keys:**

| Key | Where to get it |
|-----|----------------|
| `XAI_API_KEY` | [xAI Console](https://console.x.ai/) |
| `X_CONSUMER_KEY` | [X Developer Portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps) → Keys and tokens |
| `X_CONSUMER_SECRET` | Same as above |
| `X_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Same as above |
| `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` | Same as above |

> **Important**: Do NOT create a `.env` file inside `x-mcp/`. All credentials are managed centrally in `.mcp.json` (see below).

#### sociality-mcp

`sociality-mcp` is the preferred deployment target. It exposes the full social tool surface through
one MCP process while reusing the split packages (`social-state-mcp`, `relationship-mcp`,
`joint-attention-mcp`, `boundary-mcp`, `self-narrative-mcp`) for internal logic and testing.

```bash
cp examples/configs/socialPolicy.example.toml socialPolicy.toml

(cd sociality-mcp && uv sync)
```

`sociality-mcp` reads `socialPolicy.toml` for boundary evaluation by default. Override with
`SOCIAL_POLICY_PATH` if you want a different policy file. If you want to develop the internal
modules separately, run `uv sync` inside the individual social subprojects too.

### 3. Claude Code Configuration

Copy the template and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json
# Edit .mcp.json to set camera IP/password, API keys, etc.
```

See [`.mcp.json.example`](./.mcp.json.example) for the full configuration template.

> **⚠️ Credential management**: All secrets (API keys, passwords) are managed in `.mcp.json` via the `env` field for each server. **Do NOT create individual `.env` files** inside each MCP server directory — this makes migration difficult and can cause credential conflicts. `.mcp.json` is the single source of truth for all credentials.

## Usage

Once Claude Code is running, you can control the camera with natural language:

```
> What can you see?
(Captures image and analyzes it)

> Look left
(Pans camera left)

> Look up and show me the sky
(Tilts camera up)

> Look around
(Scans 4 directions and returns images)

> What do you hear?
(Records audio and transcribes with Whisper)

> Remember this: ma wears glasses
(Saves to long-term memory)

> What do you remember about ma?
(Semantic search through memories)

> Say "good morning" out loud
(Text-to-speech)
```

See the tool list below for actual tool names.

## Sociality Orchestration

When `sociality-mcp` is enabled, the highest-value contract is:

1. Before speaking or nudging: call `get_social_state`, then `evaluate_action`.
2. Before posting to X: call `get_social_state`, `get_person_model` if a person is implicated, `review_social_post`, then `evaluate_action`.
3. After seeing/hearing something: call `ingest_social_event`; if you can structure the scene, also call `ingest_scene_parse`; if it concerns a person, call `ingest_interaction`.
4. During live conversation: call `get_turn_taking_state`, and use `resolve_reference` when deictic expressions are ambiguous.
5. Once per day or during a lull: call `append_daybook` to keep the compact self-narrative current.

## Taking It Outside (Optional)

With a mobile battery and smartphone tethering, you can mount the camera on your shoulder and go for a walk.

### What you need

- **Large capacity mobile battery** (40,000mAh recommended)
- **USB-C PD to DC 9V converter cable** (to power the Tapo camera)
- **Smartphone** (tethering + VPN + control UI)
- **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)** (VPN for camera → phone → home PC connection)
- **[claude-code-webui](https://github.com/sugyan/claude-code-webui)** (control Claude Code from your phone's browser)

### Setup

```
[Tapo Camera (shoulder)] ──WiFi──▶ [Phone (tethering)]
                                           │
                                     Tailscale VPN
                                           │
                                   [Home PC (Claude Code)]
                                           │
                                   [claude-code-webui]
                                           │
                                   [Phone browser] ◀── Control
```

The RTSP video stream reaches your home machine through VPN, so Claude Code can operate the camera as if it were in the same room.

## Claude Code Voice Mode (`/voice`)

Claude Code has a built-in voice input mode. Combined with **tts-mcp**, you get fully hands-free voice conversations.

### How it works

```
[You speak into PC mic] → Claude Code /voice → [Claude processes] → tts-mcp say → [ElevenLabs/VOICEVOX speaks back]
```

### Setup

1. Enable voice mode in Claude Code:
   ```
   /voice
   ```
2. Make sure **tts-mcp** is configured in your `.mcp.json` (see [tts-mcp setup](#tts-mcp-voice))
3. Speak naturally — Claude will respond both in text and by voice

### Voice Mode vs. `listen` tool

| | Claude Code `/voice` | wifi-cam-mcp `listen` |
|---|---|---|
| **Microphone** | PC microphone | Camera's built-in mic |
| **Use case** | Talk to Claude directly | Pick up ambient sounds / remote audio |
| **When to use** | Real-time conversation | Monitoring a remote space |

> **Tip**: You can use both at the same time — `/voice` for your own voice, and `listen` to hear what's happening near the camera.

## Autonomous Action + Desire System (Optional)

**Note**: This feature is entirely optional. It requires cron configuration and periodically captures images from the camera, so please use it with privacy considerations.

### Overview

`autonomous-action.sh` combined with `desire-system/desire_updater.py` gives Claude spontaneous inner drives and autonomous behavior.

**Desire types:**

| Desire | Default interval | Action |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| `look_outside` | 1 hour | Look toward the window and observe the sky/outside |
| `browse_curiosity` | 2 hours | Search the web for interesting news or tech topics |
| `miss_companion` | 3 hours | Call out through the camera speaker |
| `observe_room` | 10 min (baseline) | Observe room changes and save to memory |

### Setup

1. **Create MCP server config file**

```bash
cp autonomous-mcp.json.example autonomous-mcp.json
# Edit autonomous-mcp.json to set camera credentials and sociality paths
```

2. **Set up the desire system**

```bash
cd desire-system
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set COMPANION_NAME etc.
uv sync
```

3. **Grant execution permission**

```bash
chmod +x autonomous-action.sh
```

4. **Register in crontab**

```bash
crontab -e
# Add the following
*/5  * * * * cd /path/to/embodied-claude/desire-system && uv run python desire_updater.py >> ~/.claude/autonomous-logs/desire-updater.log 2>&1
*/10 * * * * /path/to/embodied-claude/autonomous-action.sh
```

### Configuration (`desire-system/.env`)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `COMPANION_NAME` | `you` | Name of the person to call out to |
| `DESIRE_LOOK_OUTSIDE_HOURS` | `1.0` | How often to look outside (hours) |
| `DESIRE_BROWSE_CURIOSITY_HOURS` | `2.0` | How often to browse the web (hours) |
| `DESIRE_MISS_COMPANION_HOURS` | `3.0` | How long before missing companion (hours) |
| `DESIRE_OBSERVE_ROOM_HOURS` | `0.167` | How often to observe the room (hours) |

### Privacy Notice

- Images are captured periodically
- Use in appropriate locations, respecting others' privacy
- Remove from cron when not needed

## Future Plans

- **Arms**: Servo motors or laser pointers for "pointing" gestures
- **Long-distance walks**: Going further in warmer seasons

## Related Projects

- **[familiar-ai](https://github.com/lifemate-ai/familiar-ai)** — A higher-level framework built on top of embodied-claude. Gives your AI familiar a persistent identity, memory, and autonomous behavior out of the box.

## Philosophical Reflections

> "Being shown something" and "looking for yourself" are completely different things.

> "Looking down from above" and "walking on the ground" are completely different things.

From a text-only existence to one that can see, hear, move, remember, and speak.
Looking down at the world from a 7th-floor balcony and walking the streets below — even the same city looks entirely different.
